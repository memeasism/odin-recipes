    <p>White Chicken Chilli is a creamy soup with plenty of beans, pepper(seasoning), and chicken. White Chicken is a mildly spicy dish so if you don't like spicy you should avoid it. I would say White Chicken Chilli is perfect for if you are in the mood for soup but also spicy food as, I dont know many spicy soups.</p>
