    <h1>The Good Seasoning</h1>

    <p>This is a guide on how to make a very basic season that I love so much I put it on any food I make, whether a little bit or a full dry rub. This seasoning is what you want it to be, I literally guess amounts but, when its done it tastes different to everyone but, it's always good. This is a peppery seasoning with many different types of peppers all mixed together for peppery goodness.</p>
    <ul>
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <li>paprika</li>
      <li>cayenne</li>
      <li>ground pepper</li>
      <li>garlic powder</li>
      <li>onion powder</li>
      <li>salt</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <h2>Directions</h2>
      <li>I would consider this a libre recipe so just add until you think it tastes amazing.</li>
      <li>I would start by doing about 0.5 tbsp. of salt and 4 tbsp. of garlic and onion powder.</li>
      <li>Now you want to start adding the rest, I suggest 2 tbsp. of ground pepper, and 8 of cayenne or 8 of paprika, because their flavor is so similar I suggest 8 tbsp. of one or 4 tbsp. of each. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>I will possibly update this with what the actual amounts I suggest is, this is just guessing based of the ratio of how it usually goes when I make it.</p>
